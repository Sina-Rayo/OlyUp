# OlyUp

A **Django-based application** for automated grading of long-form, step-by-step exam answers.  
It supports **stepwise evaluation**, **context-aware corrections**, and provides **structured feedback** with scores.

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Evaluation:** Each part of the answer is evaluated in sequence, considering the previous sections.  
- **Context-Aware Correction:** Ensures that each step is consistent with prior steps.  
- **Structured JSON Output:** Each step returns a JSON with `is_valid`, `confidence_score`, `explanation`, and `feedback`.  
- **Overall Scoring:** Aggregates all step evaluations into a final score and detailed feedback.  
- **Database Integration:** Each step is saved in the database as itâ€™s graded for persistence and further analysis.  
- **Token/API Ready:** Can be connected to a language model API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for evaluation.
